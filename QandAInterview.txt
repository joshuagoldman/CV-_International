you must be the change you see in the world
An eye for an eye only ends up the whole world blind


What are you currently working with?
I'm working in a company called Syntronic, which is a company that develop technical solutions.
What I'm doing is that I'm working towards major Telecom company Ericsson, and there I 
help develop test system software for Ericsson's aftermarket services.

What was your master thesis about?
My master's thesis was about investigating the potential of concentrated solar collectors in various countries.
So concentrated solar collectors are solar collectors that concentrate the heat towards one point, reaching temperatures up to 100-160 degrees celsius.
For instance, I looked into a country, and attempted to estimate the area of solar collectors required to replace the heat demand at that temperature range.

Where do you see yourself in 2 years?
I don't really think in those terms, for me it's more about developing myself mentally and to grow as a person,
and for that, you don't need to be in a specific place having a particular position.
So to answer your question - in 2 years I both see myself as someone working in a company in Israel,
but I also see myself as living by myself in a cabin in northern sweden.

What drives you?
I've discovered there are 2 things that really drive me.

The first thing is how powerful a computer can be. The only thing you need to do is to know how to manipulate it in the right.
Why let someone do the same boring job a 1000 times,
when you can instead make a program and let the computer do the work for you?

And the other thing is the idea of combining knowledge with people. Think about what one person can accomplish,
and then imagine what 2, 3 or 100 people can do together if only they can collaborate and work towards the same goal?
